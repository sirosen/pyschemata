# CHANGELOG

pyschemata uses CalVer, and follows the following simple versioning policy:

- Data is never guaranteed to be stable as it always matches the upstream
  source

- Changes which are deemed likely to cause breakage (e.g. method removals) are
  preceded by a deprecation period. Exact timelines decided on a case-by-case basis

- No other strict compatibility guaranteed, but the API should be mostly stable
  after the first non-alpha, non-beta release

# 22.6.0a1

- Initial version
- Include a vendored copy of SchemaStore
